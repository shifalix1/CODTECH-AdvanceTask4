**Project Description**

**Title:** Machine Learning Model Implementation for Spam Detection

**Objective:** This project focuses on developing a predictive model to classify text messages as spam or ham (not spam) using advanced machine learning techniques.

**Features:**

Data Processing: Reads and preprocesses a dataset of text messages, encoding labels and vectorizing text.
Machine Learning: Implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to predict message categories.
Evaluation: Measures model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix visualization.
Modular Design: Provides reusable and flexible code for different datasets and use cases.

**Applications:**

Email spam filtering
Messaging platform content moderation
Fraudulent message detection
